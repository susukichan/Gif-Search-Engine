# 📋Gif Search Engine

![Alt text](img/giphy.gif?raw=true)

This is single-page Gif Search Engine powered by GIPHY API. When a user lands on the page, they should be able to see the trending Gif images from GIPHY. They can also search for the gifs they want. In this project, I used little bit of Bootstrap and flexbox for the layout, vanilla Javascript for fetching the API and interaction.

## 💡 How to use

1. Trending gifs: When user land on the page, they can see the trending gifs from GIPHY.
2. Search bar: They can type the keywords to search for gifs. While loading, there is a message "Please wait..." for the loading state. They can type another keyword to search for different result.
3. Search result: The trending gifs would be replaced with search result.
4. Result not found: If the keyword doesn't exist or any errors occur it will have the message "something went wrong".
